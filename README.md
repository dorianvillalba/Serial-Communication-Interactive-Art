# Arduino-Controlled Virtual Art Exhibit

Welcome to this innovative intersection of art, technology, and interaction. This unique project features a virtual art exhibit where the artwork, a bird within a frame, can be controlled using an Arduino controller.


## Overview

Experience art like never before with this Arduino-controlled virtual art exhibit. You can control a bird within a frame, adding a layer of interaction to the visual appreciation of art. This project uses an Arduino controller to navigate the bird, bridging the gap between physical and digital interfaces.


**Current Features:**

1. **Interactive Artwork:** The interactive bird within a frame adds a layer of depth and engagement to the exhibit.
2. **Arduino Controller:** The exhibit is controlled using an Arduino controller, offering a unique hardware-software interaction.
